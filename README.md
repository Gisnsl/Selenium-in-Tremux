This project automates the Firefox browser in headless mode using Selenium, while setting up a VNC server for graphical interface access in Termux. It ensures that the required packages are installed and handles the configuration automatically.

## Features
- Automates the Firefox browser with Selenium in headless mode.
- Configures and runs a VNC server on Termux.
- Sets up a VNC password for secure access.
- Installs necessary packages like `geckodriver`, `tigervnc`, and `selenium` if not already installed.
- Allows remote graphical access to the Termux environment via VNC.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- You need to have [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) installed on your Android device.
- Ensure that Python and pip are installed in Termux.

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Install required packages**:
   The script will automatically install the required packages if they are missing. It includes:
   - `geckodriver`
   - `tigervnc`

   However, if you need to install them manually, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade 
   pkg install python
   pkg install git
   pkg install curl
   pkg install geckodriver
   pkg install tigervnc
   pip install selenium

Set up VNC: After installing the necessary packages, set up and run VNC:

bash

When prompted, create a password for VNC. The default password can be 123456, but you can set your own.

Kill the VNC session: After setting up VNC, you can kill the session with:

bash
نسخ الكود
vncserver -kill :1
